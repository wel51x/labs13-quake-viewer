1Ô∏è‚É£ [Product Canvas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VORgfy4NYIVwX3FbBquFEKgTRFTOAEilD66AOqFRFjY/)

Visualizations of earthquakes by location, magnitude, and depth on a world map. Have the ability to zoom in and scroll over the world map. Statistical information about the data ie. are there correlations between magnitude and depth or any other variables. Average magnitude based on timeline and region.

### How to Build Application for Local Development

1. Clone/fork this repo. In the root of the directory, create  virtual environment ([guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/))
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. Activate the environment

    Windows
    ```
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    macOS and Linux
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install requirements
    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` in the root directory of this repo with the following info. **This file is not version controlled**. This is where we place secret credentials.
    ```
    FLASK_APP=app:APP
    FLASK_ENV="development"
    ```

5. Run the server in development
    ```
    flask run
    ```

6. _Optional:_ Create an ipython kernel to use Jupyter Notebook with this environment. After calling `jupyter notebook`, you'll need to select this kernel in the interface (see [documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)).
    ```
    ipython kernel install --user --name=earthquakes-env
    ```
