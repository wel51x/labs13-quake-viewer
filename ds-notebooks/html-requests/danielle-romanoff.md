A paragraph overview of your work, and a screenshot of your favorite visualization from your research.

This project focused on earthquakes on a global scale. The initial data provoked many questions. This project could be explored for a great deal more time. However, in the time allotted, we needed to focus on a small set of questions. 

My focus was on the damage caused by earthquake events. This included deaths, reports of people missing, injuries, the cost of damage, the number of houses damaged, and the number of houses destroyed. While researching this, an additional factor came to light. 

Tsunamis occur due to several reasons. The two most common are submarine landslides and earthquakes. Because many earthquakes generate tsunamis, it was important to consider this in the research being done. 

The damage assessment fell into three categories. Damage caused by earthquakes based on magnitude. Damage caused by earthquakes based on magnitude and whether a tsunami was generated or not, and the total cost incurred based on magnitude when an earthquake occurred.

In order to understand the data, I created many plots, charts, and graphs. To choose just one as a favorite is difficult. You can view all the plots if you view the notebook from one of the damage assessment pages. That said, there was an interesting plot I did of deaths caused by earthquakes both with and without a tsunami occurring. Here is an image of that plot.

Deaths resulting from earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 7.0
